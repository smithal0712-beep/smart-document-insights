## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-document-insights.git
cd smart-document-insights

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
 PDF Upload
     │
     ▼
 PyPDF → Text Chunks
     │
     ▼
 Sentence Transformers → Embeddings
     │
     ▼
 FAISS Index (stored in memory)
     │
     ▼
 User Query → Top-K Retrieval
     │
     ▼
 Groq Llama 3 → Grounded Answer
```

1. **Load** — The PDF is parsed and split into overlapping text chunks.
2. **Embed** — Each chunk is encoded into a dense vector using a Sentence Transformer model.
3. **Index** — Vectors are stored in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
4. **Retrieve** — On each user query, the top-K most relevant chunks are fetched.
5. **Generate** — Retrieved context is passed to Groq's Llama 3, which synthesizes a precise answer.
